Introduction to Database Management

This course covers several topics of database design and development. It covers analyzing the data and data organizational needs of organizations and applying the Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model for building information systems. E-R models are transformed into relational models and used to create database relational schema. SQL is used for database creation, manipulation, and control.
